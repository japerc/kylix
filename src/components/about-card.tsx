              The Kylix Classifier helps users distinguish between Archaic and
              Classical kylix fragments. I chose this project because I found it
              challenging to make this distinction myself. This made it the perfect
              case study to learn about image classification with deep learning.

              This app uses a React (Vite) frontend, with model inference hosted on Hugging Face Spaces
              using Gradio. The model is a fine-tuned ResNet-18 pretrained on ImageNet, achieving 78%
              accuracy on the validation set.

              The model was fine-tuned on public domain images of kylix fragments
              from The METâ€™s open access collection.

              Through this project, I gained practical experience with fine-tuning pretrained models
              and deploying them using Hugging Face Spaces and Gradio. I also learned
              the basics of React states, hooks and renders. Overall, it was a useful
              learning experience in both deep learning and frontend integration.
