# Kylix Fragment Classifier

App to call Neural network for the classification of Kylix fragments as 'archaic' or 'classical'.

I'm learning about deep learning and web development in React and I'm applying what I learn in this project.

Training code is based on fast.ai's [Practical Deep Learning](https://course.fast.ai) course material.

The data was obtained through the [MET API](https://metmuseum.github.io). All images used for training are in the public domain.
