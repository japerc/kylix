# kylix-fragment-classifier

Neural network for the classification of Kylix fragments as 'archaic' or 'classical'.

This project was undertaken as an introduction to deep learning.

Much of the code is based on fast.ai's [Practical Deep Learning](https://course.fast.ai) course material.

The data was obtained through the [MET API](https://metmuseum.github.io). All images used for training are in the public domain.
